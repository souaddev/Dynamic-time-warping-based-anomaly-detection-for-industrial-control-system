# Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) Based Anomaly Detection For Industrial Control System using SWaT Dataset

This repository presents a comprehensive approach to anomaly detection in **Industrial Control Systems (ICS)**, with a focus on the **Secure Water Treatment DataSet (SWaT)**. 
The implementation incorporates cutting-edge machine learning techniques, including **Isolation Forest** and **Autoencoder** models, augmented by the powerful **Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm**.
