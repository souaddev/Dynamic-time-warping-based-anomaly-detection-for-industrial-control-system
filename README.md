# Dynamic-time-warping-based-anomaly-detection-for-industrial-control-system

This repository presents a comprehensive approach to anomaly detection in **Industrial Control Systems (ICS)**, with a focus on the **Secure Water Treatment DataSet (SWaT)**. 
The implementation incorporates cutting-edge machine learning techniques, including **Isolation Forest** and **Autoencoder** models, augmented by the powerful **Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm**.
